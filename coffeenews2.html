        going to come face-to-face. On one hand, the Gemini can be outgoing, flirtatious, communicative, and ready for fun, fun,
        fun. Yet when the other twin is present, you can find this air sign contemplative, serious, restless, and even indecisive.</span></div>

        the surface. Excellent leaders, Scorpions are always aware. When it comes to resourcefulness, this sign comes out ahead.</span></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_down</i>Sagittarius</div>

        eccentric, and energetic. Both are deep thinkers with a love of helping others. Highly intellectual, this is a sign of fierce independence that prizes intuition tempered with logic. Both
        personality types have an uncanny ability to see both sides of an argument without prejudice, making them excellent problem-solvers.</span></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_down</i>Pisces</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>"Understanding" is a most appropriate keyword for this gentle, affectionate sign. Easygoing and generally accepting of others around them, Pisceans are
        often found in the company of a variety of different personalities. Their willingness to give of themselves emotionally lends to an aura of quiet empathy. A Pisces is comforting to be around.
        While not likely to be the leader, this sign's presence is strong and vibrant in any cause they put their hearts into.</span></div>
